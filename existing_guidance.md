### Guidance made by DHSC
[R package to make accessible plots using DHSC colour palettes](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDataS-DHSC%2FDHSC_colours&data=04%7C01%7CHannah.D.Thomas%40ons.gov.uk%7C6accbceea6b0444aeeec08d966d693fb%7C078807bfce824688bce00d811684dc46%7C0%7C0%7C637653894773954444%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0&sdata=PPpowqfAhZjBxHXkOwfmNcu8neISJh6LwyxRxNn%2Bkp0%3D&reserved=0)

### Guidance from DfT
[R Shiny app that allows you to select colours and see if they meet colour contrast regulations](https://fran-bryden-dft.shinyapps.io/chart_accessibility-main/). It also allows you to check what it looks like in black and white. Unsure if the checker tool checks the contrast between the colour and the white background.

## Other things to consider

- Using colours to connect information  (Style.ONS advice) – This can get more complicated if a team wants to use one colour for adults, one for children, one for men, one for women throughout a publication. May lead to people wanting to use tints of the same colour. 
- Departments have their own colour schemes and may be attached to departmental branding.
<!-- Cam Race: I think both of the above should be handled by a little bit of guidance around making custom palettes, and pointing to tools to help analysts in doing this, have started a section above -->
- The guidance on ONS seems to suggest it is OK to use line charts with lots of lines, which maybe wouldn’t be considered best practice now?
<!-- Cam Race: I'd agree that is isn't best practice and think what we have is fine for now -->
