## Track of conversation between Hannah Thomas (Analysis Function dissemination lead based in ONS) and Duncan Garmonsway at the Government Digital Service.

Duncan's question:

What are the user needs?  For example, types of visualisation, colour/greyscale printing and photocopying, compatibility with different software (some software only supports the RGB colour space), number of colours to use at once, tools to encourage adoption.

My answer: 

Can’t all Hex codes be converted to RGB codes? -- Yes, but the best "perceptually uniform" palettes don't fit into the RGB colour space.  See the excellent Seaborn article about palettes (a pretty helpful article in general).

I think some users would still want to print maybe, if the colours meet WCAG won’t it work on greyscale?  

Duncan’s answer: 

I don't know the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) fully, but as far as I do know, it only considers the contrast between foreground and background, rather than between adjacent panels of colour.  Here's an example of when it might not work: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/242682/qualitative-color-palette-photocopy-safe-grayscale-ready 

Duncan’s question: 

Are the ONS Brand Guidelines a good choice for a cross-government palette?  Only pairs of colours in that palette have been tested for accessibility.  Many other palettes have been designed specifically for accessible statistical publications, and for different purposes (sequential, qualitative, diverging, cartography, colormaps), although I don't know of any that have been tested against the WCAG.

My answer: 

I chose it because it was the only one I could find! Aside from the colours used on the HTML stacked bar chart on GOV.UK – but then you said those colours were designed for text and not charts.  

Duncan’s answer: 

This Seaborn article mentions the most widely used accessible palettes, and there are others too, such as the ones in the R package khroma.   

My question: 

How do you know only pairs have been tested in the ONS colour scheme? Is that written somewhere? 

Duncan’s answer: 

I'm guessing that only pairs have been tested, because that's what's presented in the accessibility section in the brand guidelines.  That page also mentions that the palette will be revised, so perhaps there is someone who knows its limitations and how they might be addressed.

My question: 

Can you point me towards any other colour schemes you know have been tested further for accessibility? 

Duncan’s answer: 

This Seaborn article mentions the most widely used accessible palettes, and there are others too, such as the ones in the R package khroma.  They have been extensively tested, but not to WCAG as far as I know.  Perhaps WCAG doesn't consider everything that matters in data visualisations.

Duncan’s question: 

Ownership?  Whose responsibility will it be to publish and maintain the recommendations, provide software tools to encourage adoption, and to notice and softly discourage use of other palettes?

My answer: 

Once we have something in place I am sure my team would be happy to take ownership of any guidance for the Analysis Function.  -- Great!

I am not talking software tools though. At least not in the short term, it would be for (the majority of) people creating charts on Excel and PowerPoint.  Only a very few departments are able to create charts in HTML. And they could use the hex colour codes couldn’t they? We would also be happy to promote the colour palette via the presentation champions for the Analysis Function/GSS.
