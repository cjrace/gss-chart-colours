# Task and finish meeting 2

## To do list

1. Update chart images to match best practice around labelling lines
2. Expand on section below success criterion 1.4.1
3. Add black and white versions of each of the palettes
4. Add sequential colour palette
5. Add vertical 2,3,4 versions of palette
6. Once agreed, add RGB, and CMYK colour codes.
7. Add extra detail around patterns/dashed/dotted lines and bars


## Questions for Hannah/Heather

1. When making a sequential palette, it's not possible to have more than two shades while keeping the 3:1 contrast ratio, are we happy that we can stretch away from this if charts are meeting the other two key success criterion?
2. Hannah, you mentioned research on dashed/dotted lines, (and not using shapes on lines) any thoughts on how we could do this, could it be as simple as contacting DAC?
3. Agree suggestion for B+W checking, is print previewing for greyscale and eyeballing enough?
4. Hannah, are there any other things you'd want to explore/ask/have before the guidance could then be shared wider for feedback and approval?


## Updates since last time

We've collated the comments from within the meeting and the feedback sent in afterwards, which has lead to the following updates:

1. Moving the focus from contrast ratios to a blend of all 3 success criterion
2. Label line charts directly
3. Add a new example palette for sequential data (TODO)
4. Added guidance around fonts and colours for text and labelling around charts


## Questions to take to the group

1. Any further feedback collected in between the meetings?
2. Is anyone aware of any research, or had success in using dashed/dotted lines?
3. Is anyone aware of any research, or had success in using patterned/dotted bars (stacked/clustered)?
